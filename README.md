## Overview
### Description
OnCampus is an interface based social media app for school campuses that aims to build school spirit and a sense of community while fostering interaction among students. OnCampus is a map of student groups. Each certified student group can create their building anywhere on the map and customize it to their taste. Each building is a button to a chat for that student group. Each new building can be located in a random area of the map such that the buildings are furthest apart(this would likely require some algorithm), this can be initiated by the school app admin.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** The app needs to be on mobile since it is meant to an everyday app for groups to connect and feel like they are somewhat in the same room
- **Story:** Allows users to get involved in the groups on their campus and have a sense of belonging to the social ecosystem of their campus by providing interfacing that makes for the ease of advertisement of campus groups and interaction with such.
- **Market:** Students at campuses with a lot of clubs and student groups
- **Habit:** Users can log in and see a view of campus and can in later models access stories associated with group buildings. Public groups or private groups that students are a part of would be available to them OnClick and they are led to a group messaging view.
- **Scope:** Later inprovements of the app would provide weekly story reels from all the groups(most viewed stories compiled) and would alert members of a group or people associated with the group when there is a lot of activity in the group.
